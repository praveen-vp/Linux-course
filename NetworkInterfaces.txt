NetWork Interfaces
====================

Network intetrfaces are a connection channel between a device and a
network. Physically, network interfaces can proceed through a network
interface card(NIC) or can be more abractly implemented as a software.
Can operate multiple network interfaces simultaneosly.  Specific
interfaces can be brought up (activated) or brought down (de-activated)
at any time.

A list of currently active network interfaces is reported by the ifconfig
utility which you may have to run as the superuser, or at least, give
the full path, i.e., /sbin/ifconfig, on some distributions.
