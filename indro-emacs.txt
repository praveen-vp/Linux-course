Introduction to emacs
--------------------------

The emacs editor is a popular competitor for vi. Unlike vi, it does not
work with modes. emacs is highly customizable and includes a large number
of features. It was initially designed for use on a console, but was soon
adapted to work with a GUI as well. emacs has many other capabilities
other than simple text editing; it can be used for email, debugging, etc.

Rather than having different modes for command and insert, like vi,
emacs uses the CTRL and Meta (Alt or Esc) keys for special commands.
