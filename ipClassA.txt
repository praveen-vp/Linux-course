	Class A Network Addresses 
	==========================

 > Class A addresses use the first octet of an IP address as their
 Net ID and use the other three octets as the Host ID. The first bit
 of the first octet is always set to zero. So you can use only 7-bits
 for unique network numbers. As a result, there are a maximum of 126
 Class A networks available (the addresses 0000000 and 1111111 are
 reserved). Not surprisingly, this was only feasible when there were
 very few unique networks with large numbers of hosts. As the use of the
 Internet expanded, Classes B and C were added in order to accomodate
 the growing demand for independent networks.

Each Class A network can have up to 16.7 million unique hosts on its
network. The range of host address is from 1.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255.
