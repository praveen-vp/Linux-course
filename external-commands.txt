Using External Commands 
-------------------------

Typing :sh command opens an external command shell.  When you exit the
shell, you will resume your vi editing session.

Typing :!executes a command from within vi. The command follows the
exclamation point.  This technique best suited for non-interactive
commands such as: :! wc %

Typing this will run the wc (word count) command on the file; the
character % represents the file currently being edited.

The 'fmt' command does simple formatting of text.  If you are editing a
file and want the file to look nice, you can run the file through fmt.
One way to do this while editing is by using :%!fmt, which runs the entire
file (the % part) through fmt and replaces the file with the results.
