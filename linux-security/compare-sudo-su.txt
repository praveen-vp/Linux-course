Comparing sudo and su
----------------------------
In Linux you can use either su or sudo to temporarily grant root access
to a normal user; these methods are actually quite different. Listed
below are the differences between the two commands.


su 
--
 > When elevating privilege, you need to enter the root password. 
  Giving the root password to a normal user should never, ever be done.

 > Once a user elevates to the root account using su, the user can do 
   anything that the root user can do for as long as the user wants, 
   without being asked again for a password.  

 > The command has limited logging features.

sudo 
---- 
  > When elevating privilege, you need to enter the userâ€™s 
     password and not the root password.
  
  > Offers more features and is considered more secure and more configurable. 
    Exactly what the user is allowed to do can be precisely controlled and limited. 
    By default the user will either always have to keep giving their 
    password to do further operations with sudo, or can avoid doing 
    so for a configurable time interval. 


sudo Features

  sudo has the ability to keep track of unsuccessful attempts at gaining root access. 
  Users' authorization for using sudo is based on configuration information stored 
  in the /etc/sudoers file and in the /etc/sudoers.d directory.
