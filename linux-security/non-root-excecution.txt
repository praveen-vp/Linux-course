Operations That Do Not Require root Privileges
-------------------------------------------------

A regular account user can perform some operations requiring special
permissions; however, the system configuration must allow such abilities
to be exercised.

SUID (Set owner User ID upon executionâ€”similar to the Windows "run as"
feature) is a special kind of file permission given to a file. SUID
provides temporary permissions to a user to run a program with the
permissions of the file owner  (which may be root) instead of the
permissions held by the user.

Examples of operations which do not require root privileges:

 >> Running a network client
 >> Using devices such as printers
 >> Operations on files that the user has proper permissions to access.
 >> Running SUID-root applications.
