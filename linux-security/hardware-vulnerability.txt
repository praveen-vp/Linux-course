>>> When hardware is physically accessible, security can be compromised by:

    > Key logging: Recording the real time activity of a computer user including
      the keys they press. The captured data can either be stored locally or
      transmitted to remote machines.

    > Network sniffing: Capturing and viewing
      the network packet level data on your network. 

    > Booting with a live or rescue disk .
      
    > Remounting and modifying disk content

>>> It security policy should start with requirments on how to properly secure physical
    access to servers and workstations. Physical access to a system makes it possible for 
    attackers to easily leverage several attack vectors. in a way that makes all operating 
    system level recomendations irrelevant.

  >> guid lines : 
      > lock down workstations and server
      > Protect your network links such that it cannot be accessed by people you do not trust.
      > Protect your keyboards where passwords are entered to ensure the keyboards cannot be tampered with.
      > Ensure a password protects the BIOS in such a way that the system cannot be booted with 
        a live rescue DVD or USB key.

  For single user computers and those in a home environment some of the above features 
  (like preventing booting from removable media) can be excessive, and you can avoid 
  implementing them. However, if sensitive information is on your system that requires 
  careful protection, either it shouldn't be there or it should be better protected by 
  following the above guidelines.
