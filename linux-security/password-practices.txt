Good Password Practices
-------------------------

IT professionals follow several good practices for securing the data
and the password of every user.

  > Password aging is a method to ensure that users get prompts that remind
    them to create a new password after a specific period. This can ensure
    that passwords, if cracked, will only be usable for a limited amount
    of time. This feature is implemented using chage, which configures the
    password expiry information for a user. 
   'chage' utility
  
  > Another method is to force users to set strong passwords using Pluggable 
    Authentication Modules(PAM). PAM can be configured to automatically verify 
    that a password created or modified using the passwd utility is 
    sufficiently strong. PAM configuration is implemented using a library called
    'pam_cracklib.so', which can also be replaced by 'pam_passwdqc.so'
    for more options. 
 
  > One can also install password cracking programs, such as John The Ripper, 
    to secure the password file and detect weak password entries. It is 
    recommended that written authorization be obtained before installing such 
    tools on any system that you do not own.
