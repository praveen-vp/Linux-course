How Passwords are Stored 
-------------------------

  The system verifies authenticity and identity using user
credentials. Originally, encrypted passwords were stored in the
/etc/passwd file, which was readable by everyone. This made it rather
easy for passwords to be cracked.

  On modern systems, passwords are actually
stored in an encrypted format in a secondary file named /etc/shadow. Only
those with root access can modify/read this file.

Password Encryption
-------------------------
  Protecting passwords has become a crucial element of security. Most
Linux distributions rely on a modern password encryption algorithm
called SHA-512 (Secure Hashing Algorithm 512 bits), developed by the
U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) to encrypt passwords.

  The SHA-512 algorithm is widely used for security applications and
protocols. These security applications and protocols include TLS, SSL,
PHP, SSH, S/MIME and IPSec. SHA-512 is one of the most tested hashing
algorithms.
