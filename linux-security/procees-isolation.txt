Process Isolation
------------------

Linux is considered to be more secure than many other operating systems
because processes are naturally isolated from each other. One process
normally cannot access the resources of another process, even when that
process is running with the same user privileges. Linux thus makes it
difficult (though certainly not impossible) for viruses and security
exploits to access and attack random resources on a system.

Additional security mechanisms that have been recently introduced in
order to make risks even smaller are:

  > Control Groups (cgroups): Allows system administrators to group 
    processes and associate finite resources to each cgroup.

  > Linux Containers (LXC): Makes it possible to run multiple isolated 
    Linux systems (containers) on a single system by relying on cgroups.

  > Virtualization: Hardware is emulated in such a way that not only 
    processes can be isolated, but entire systems are run simultaneously 
    as isolated and insulated guests (virtual machines) on one physical host.
