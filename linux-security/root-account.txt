Understanding the root Account 
--------------------------------

'root' is the most privileged account on a Linux/UNIX system. This
account has the ability to carry out all facets of system administration,
including adding accounts, changing user passwords, examining log files,
installing software, etc. Utmost care must be taken when using this
account. It has no security restrictions imposed upon it.

When you are signed in as, or acting as root, the shell prompt displays
'#'  (if you are using bash and you haven’t customized the  prompt
as we discuss elsewhere in this course). This convention is intended to
serve as a warning to you of the absolute power of this account.


Operations that Require root Privileges
-----------------------------------------

root privileges are required to perform operations such as:

Creating, removing and managing user accounts.  Managing software
packages.  Removing or modifying system files.  Restarting system
services.  Regular account users of Linux distributions may be allowed
to install software packages, update some settings, and apply various
kinds of changes to the system. However, root privilege is required for
performing administration tasks such as restarting services, manually
installing packages and managing parts of the filesystem that are outside
the normal user’s directories.


Commands : 
    # useradd <username>
    # passwd <username>
