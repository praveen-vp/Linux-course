Requiring Boot Loader Passwords
----------------------------------

You can secure the boot process with a secure password to prevent someone
from bypassing the user authentication step. For systems using the GRUB
boot loader, for the older GRUB version 1, you can invoke grub-md5-crypt
which will prompt you for a password and then encrypt as shown on the
adjoining screen.

You then must edit /boot/grub/grub.conf by adding the following line
below the timeout entry:

password --md5 $1$Wnvo.1$qz781HRVG4jUnJXmdSCZ30

You can also force passwords for only certain boot choices rather
than all.

  For the now more common GRUB version 2 things are more complicated,
and you have more flexibility and can do things like use user-specific
passwords, which can be their normal login password.  Also you
never edit the configuration file, /boot/grub/grub.cfg, directly,
rather you edit system configuration files in /etc/grub.d and
then run update-grub. One explanation of this can be found at
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Passwords.
