Command Logging
-------------------

By default, sudo commands and any failures are logged in /var/log/auth.log
under the Debian distribution family, and in /var/log/messages or
/var/log/secure on other systems. This is an important safeguard to
allow for tracking and accountability of sudo use. A typical entry of
the message contains:

 > Calling username
 > Terminal info
 > Working directory
 > User account invoked
 > Command with arguments
