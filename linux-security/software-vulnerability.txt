  Like all software, hackers occasionally find weaknesses in the Linux
ecosystem. The strength of the Linux (and open source community in

remediated. While specific discussion of vulnerabilities is beyond
the scope of this course, we have seeded a couple relevant topics to
the Discussion Board (under the 'Local Security' topic) to encourage
futher discussion.
