User Accounts
----------------------------------

The Linux kernel allows properly authenticated users to access files and
applications. While each user is identified by a unique integer (the
user id or UID), a separate database associates a username with each
UID. Upon account creation, new user information is added to the user
database and the user's home directory must be created and populated
with some essential files. Command line programs such as useradd and
userdel as well as GUI tools are used for creating and removing accounts.

For each user, the following seven fields are maintained in the
/etc/passwd file.

1 -  Username  >  
        - User login name
        - Should be between 1 and 32 characters long

2 -  Password  > 
        - User password (or the character x if the password is stored in 
            the /etc/shadow file) in encrypted format
        - it is never shown in Linux when it is being typed; this stops prying eyes

3 -  User ID (UID) > 
        - Every user must have a user id (UID)
        - UID 0 is reserved for root user
        - UID's ranging from 1-99 are reserved for other predefined accounts
        - UID's ranging from 100-999 are reserved for system accounts and groups (except for RHEL, which reserves only up to 499)
        - Normal users have UID's of 1000 or greater, except on RHEL where they start at 500

4 -  Group ID (GID) > 
        - The primary Group ID (GID); Group Identification Number stored in the /etc/group fileWill be covered in detail in the chapter on Processes

5 -  User Info   > 
        - This field is optional and allows insertion of extra information about the user such as their name.
        - For example: praveen-vp

6 -  Home Directory  > 
        - The absolute path location of user's home directoryFor example: /home/praveen-vp
  
7 -  Shell   > 
        -The absolute location of a user's default shell  For example: /bin/bash



Types of Accounts
----------------------------------
By default, Linux distinguishes between several account types in order
to isolate processes and workloads. Linux has four types of accounts:

  >> root 
  >> System 
  >> Normal 
  >> Network
For a safe working environment, it is advised to grant the minimum 
privileges possible and necessary to accounts,and remove inactive accounts. 
The last utility, which shows the last time each user logged into the system,
can be used to help identify potentially inactive accounts which are 
candidates for system removal.

  Keep in mind that practices you use on multi-user business systems are
more strict than practices you can use on personal desktop systems that
only affect the casual user. This is especially true with security. We
hope to show you practices applicable to enterprise servers that you can
use on all systems, but understand that you may choose to relax these
rules on your own personal system.
