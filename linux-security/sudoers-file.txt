The sudoers File
--------------------
Whenever sudo is invoked, a trigger will look at /etc/sudoers and the
files in /etc/sudoers.d to determine if the user has the right to use
sudo and what the scope of their privilege is. Unknown user requests
and requests to do operations not allowed to the user even with sudo are
reported. You can edit the sudoers file by using visudo, which ensures
that only one person is editing the file at a time, has the proper
permissions, and refuses to write out the file and exit if there is an
error in the changes made.
