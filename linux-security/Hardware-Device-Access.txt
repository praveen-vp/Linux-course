  Hardware Device Access
---------------------------

Linux limits user access to non-networking hardware devices in a manner
that is extremely similar to regular file access. Applications interact by
engaging the filesystem layer (which is independent of the actual device
or hardware the file resides on). This layer will then opens a device
special file (often called a device node) under the /dev directory that
corresponds to the device being accessed. Each device special file has
standard owner, group and world permission fields. Security is naturally
enforced just as it is when standard files are accessed.

Hard disks, for example, are represented as /dev/sd*. While a root user
can read and write to the disk in a raw fashion (for example, by doing
something like:

 $ echo hello world > /dev/sda1

the standard permissions as shown in the figure make it impossible for
regular users to do so.  Writing to a device in this fashion can easily
obliterate the filesystem stored on it in a way that cannot be repaired
without great effort, if at all.  The normal reading and writing of files
on the hard disk by applications is done at a higher level through the
filesystem, and never through direct access to the device node.
