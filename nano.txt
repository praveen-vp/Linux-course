nano  is easy to use, and requires very little effort to learn. 
To open a file in nano, type nano <filename> and press Enter.  
If the file doesn't exist, it will be created.

nano provides a two line “shortcut bar” at the bottom of 
the screen that lists the available commands. Some of these commands are:

CTRL-G: Display the help screen
CTRL-O: Write to a file
CTRL-X: Exit a file
CTRL-R: Insert contents from another file to the current buffer
CTRL-C: Cancels previous commands
