Creating Aliases
------------------

You can create customized commands or modify the behavior of 
already existing ones by creating aliases. Most often these 
aliases are placed in your ~/.bashrc file so they are available
to any command shells you create.

Typing alias with no arguments will list currently defined aliases.

Please note there should not be any spaces on either side of 
the equal sign and the alias definition needs to be placed within 
either single or double quotes if it contains any spaces.
