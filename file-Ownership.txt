File Ownership
-------------------

In Linux and other UNIX-based operating systems, every file is 
associated with a user who is the owner. Every file is also 
associated with a group (a subset of all users) which has an interest 
in the file and certain rights, or permissions: read, write, and execute.

The following utility programs involve user and group ownership and permission setting.

Command	Usage
chown	Used to change user ownership of a file or directory
chgrp	Used to change group ownership
chmod	Used to change the permissions on the file which can be 
	done separately for owner, group and the rest of the world.


File Permission Modes and chmod
----------------------------------

Files have three kinds of permissions: read (r), write (w), execute (x).
These are generally represented as in 'rwx'. 
These permissions affect three groups of owners: user/owner (u), group (g), and others (o).

As a result, you have the following three groups of three permissions:

rwx: rwx: rwx
 u:   g:   o

There are a number of different ways to use chmod. 
To give the owner and others execute permission and remove the group write permission:

$ ls -l test1
-rw-rw-r-- 1 coop coop 1601 Mar 9 15:04 test1
$ chmod uo+x,g-w test1
$ ls -l test1
-rwxr--r-x 1 coop coop 1601 Mar 9 15:04 test1

NOTE: where u stands for user (owner), 
------      o stands for other (world), 
	    g stands for group.

$ chmod 755 test1

Example of chown
-----------------

$ sudo chown root file-1

Example of chgrp
-----------------

$ sudo chgrp bin file-2
