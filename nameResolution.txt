Name Resolution

Name Resolution is used to convert numerical IP address values into a
human-readable format known as the hostname. For example, 140.211.169.4
is the numerical IP address that refers to the linuxfoundation.org
hostname. Hostnames are easier to remember.

Given an IP address, you can obtain its corresponding hostname. Accessing
the machine over the network becomes easier when you can type the hostname
instead of the IP address.

You can view your systemâ€™s hostname simply by typing hostname with
no argument.

Note: If you give an argument, the system will try to change its hostname
to match it, however, only root users can do that.

The special hostname localhost is associated with the IP address
127.0.0.1, and describes the machine you are currently on (which normally
has additional network-related IP addresses).
