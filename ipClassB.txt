Class B Network Addresses

	> Class B addresses use the first two octets of the IP address
	as their Net ID and the last two octets as the Host ID. The
	first two bits of the first octet are always set to binary 10,
	so there are a maximum of 16,384 (14-bits) Class B networks. The
	first octet of a Class B address has values from 128 to 191. 
	
	> The introduction of Class B networks expanded the number of networs but it soon became clear that a further level would be needed.

	Each Class B network can support a maximum of 65,536 unique hosts on its network. 
	
	> The range of host address is from 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255.
