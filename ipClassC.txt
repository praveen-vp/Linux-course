Class C Network Addresses
===========================

	> Class C addresses use the first three octets of the IP address as their Net ID and the last octet as their Host ID. The first three bits of the first octet are set to binary 110, so almost 2.1 million (21-bits)
	> Class C networks are available. The first octet of a Class C address has values from 192 to 223.
	These are most common for smaller networks which don't have many unique hosts.

Each Class C network can support up to 256 (8-bits) unique hosts. The
range of host address is from 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255.
